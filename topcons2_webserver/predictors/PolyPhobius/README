PREREQUISITES
=============

Unix/Linux
Perl 5.6 or later
Java 1.5.0 or later
To retrieve homologs with the script blastget BioPerl(bioperl.org) is needed.
If jPhobius is to be used: The phobius.model file from your licensed copy of
phobius 

    
INSTALL
=======

Change (and create) directory to the directory where you want to install homologhmm
(e.g. /usr/local/share/jphobius ), and unpack the tar file with the command:

cat /path_to_tarfile/jphobius.tar.gz | tar xz

make a link from the file jphobius and homologhmm to a directory included in your standard
path.

ln -s /usr/local/share/jphobius/jphobius /usr/local/bin/phobius
ln -s /usr/local/share/jphobius/homologhmm /usr/local/bin/homologhmm

Make sure that java is available in the standard path

NOTE: To vitalize jPhobius please copy the file phobius model into 
the homologhmm directory (/usr/local/share/jphobius)
